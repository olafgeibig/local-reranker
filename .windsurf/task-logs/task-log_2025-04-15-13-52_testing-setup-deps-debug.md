## Task Details
- **Goal**: Switch dependency management to `uv`, add test dependencies, create an initial health check test, ensure tests run, and address warnings.
- **Implementation**:
    - Moved dependencies from `requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml`, adding `pytest` and `httpx` to `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`.
    - Deleted `requirements.txt`.
    - Created `tests/test_api.py` with `TestClient` fixture and `test_health_check`.
    - Encountered significant issues installing dependencies (`torch`) correctly using various `uv` commands (`pip sync`, `pip install .[dev]`, `pip install -e .[dev]`).
    - Explicitly added `torch` to `pyproject.toml` base dependencies.
    - Identified that `pytest` was running with the global Python, not the activated venv, causing `ModuleNotFoundError`.
    - Ran tests successfully using `python -m pytest` within the activated venv.
    - Identified FastAPI `@app.on_event` deprecation warnings.
    - Attempted to refactor `api.py` to use `lifespan` automatically but encountered tool limitations/errors.
    - Provided manual refactoring steps to the user.
- **Challenges**: Correct `uv` syntax/behavior for installing optional dependencies and handling transitive dependencies like `torch` proved difficult. Debugging was complicated by the venv activation issue masking the root cause initially. Tool limitations prevented automatic code refactoring for `lifespan`.
- **Decisions**: Iteratively tried different `uv` commands. Explicitly added `torch` dependency. Switched test execution method to `python -m pytest`. Advised manual refactoring when the automated tool failed.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: -8 / 23 (**Unacceptable**)
    - `+3` Follows language-specific style and idioms perfectly.
    - `+2` Solves the problem with minimal lines of code (test file itself).
    - `+1` Provides a portable or reusable solution (test setup).
    - `-10` Fails to solve the core problem or introduces bugs (Failed to automatically apply the critical `lifespan` refactor due to tool error).
    - `-3` Violates style conventions or includes unnecessary code (Initial attempts at dependency management were inefficient).
    - `-1` Relies on deprecated or suboptimal libraries/functions (Initial code used deprecated `@app.on_event`, although identified).
- **Strengths**: Successfully migrated to `uv`, created the initial test structure, correctly diagnosed the venv activation issue as the cause of test failures.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Need a more robust understanding of `uv` commands and potential edge cases. Must improve handling of shell interactions (e.g., quoting arguments). Need better error handling or workarounds when code editing tools fail. Should avoid generating code with deprecated features (`on_event`) if possible.
- **Remediation**: The failure to automatically refactor `api.py` requires confirmation that the user has performed the manual steps successfully.

## Next Steps
- Confirm with the user if the manual `lifespan` refactoring in `api.py` has been completed.
- If yes, re-run tests (`python -m pytest`) to verify warnings are resolved.
- Proceed with implementing tests for the `/v1/rerank` endpoint.
