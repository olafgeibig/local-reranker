## Task Details
- **Goal**: Initialize the Windsurf Memory Bank structure and core files according to the specified "SessionStart" workflow.
- **Implementation**: 
    1. Checked for existing `.windsurf` directory using `list_dir`.
    2. Created directory structure (`core`, `plans`, `task-logs`, `errors`) using `run_command mkdir -p`.
    3. Created placeholder core memory files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) using `write_to_file`.
    4. Created placeholder `memory-index.md` using `write_to_file`.
    5. Updated `activeContext.md` using `edit_file`.
    6. Created `initial-project-plan.md` in `plans/` using `write_to_file`.
    7. Created this task log file using `write_to_file`.
- **Challenges**: None.
- **Decisions**: Followed the prescribed "SessionStart" workflow. Used placeholder content for initial files.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 6/23 
    - +3: Followed workflow structure perfectly.
    - +2: Used appropriate tools efficiently for file/directory creation.
    - +1: Established standard, reusable Memory Bank structure.
- **Strengths**: Accurately followed the initialization workflow steps. Created all required files and directories correctly.
- **Areas for Improvement**: The score is low based on the provided scale, potentially indicating the scoring metric is better suited for code generation tasks. However, the task itself (scaffolding) was completed successfully as instructed.

## Next Steps
- Populate the core memory files (`.windsurf/core/*.md`) with actual project details.
- Implement checksum calculation and verification for `memory-index.md`.
- Proceed with project tasks based on the newly established context.
