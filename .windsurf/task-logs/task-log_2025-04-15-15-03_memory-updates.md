# Task Log: Initial Memory Context Updates

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-04-15
- **Time Started**: ~14:55
- **Time Completed**: ~15:03
- **Files Modified**:
    - `/Users/GEO5BE4/work/ai-experiments/local-reranker/.windsurf/core/activeContext.md`
    - `/Users/GEO5BE4/work/ai-experiments/local-reranker/.windsurf/core/techContext.md`

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Update Windsurf memory bank core context files (`activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`) based on initial project information and active development focus.
- **Implementation**:
    - Used the `edit_file` tool to update `activeContext.md` to reflect the current focus on implementing core reranking logic in `reranker.py`.
    - Used the `edit_file` tool to update `techContext.md` to include `uv` (dependency management), Python 3.12, and `pytest` (testing) based on user input.
- **Challenges**: None encountered during these updates.
- **Decisions**: Updated context files proactively based on user file interactions and explicitly based on user requests, following the Windsurf protocol.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 6/23
    - +3: Followed Markdown style conventions perfectly.
    - +2: Solved the problem with minimal lines of code (simple text edits).
    - +1: Updates contribute to the reusable Windsurf memory structure.
- **Strengths**: Accurately updated specified memory files with the correct information using appropriate tools and minimal edits. Adhered to the Windsurf structure.
- **Areas for Improvement**: The task involved simple context updates rather than complex code implementation. Consequently, the achieved score is below the 'Minimum Performance' threshold (18/23) as the scoring scale heavily rewards complexity, optimization, and handling edge cases inherent in coding tasks. Future implementation tasks will provide a better basis for evaluation against the full scale.
- **Status**: Task completed successfully, but score reflects task simplicity, not failure.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with implementing core reranking logic as outlined in `activeContext.md` and `initial-project-plan.md`.
- Update `progress.md` to reflect completion of these initial context updates.
- Add this task log to `memory-index.md`.
